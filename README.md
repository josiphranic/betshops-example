# Betshops

"Betshops"  is a testing assignment to create one page application.

Please refer to the screenshots in folder `{platform}_screenshots`.

## Behavior:

* Application shows betshops for client on map (using default mapping library for platform) -> bet shops are located in Germany
* User can move the map and zoom-in/zoom-out
* When clicking on betshop icon, detail pops out and user can see the relevant information about the betshop
* When clicking on the "Route" button, user is transferred into default navigation application to navigate to betshop location

## Tips:

* User makes the defined API call and draws markers on the map
* If user denies the location, center of the map is set to center of Munich `48.137154, 11.576124`
* Working time - suppose that working time is 08:00 - 16:00
  * If betshop is OPEN at the moment, clock label should present `Open now until [END TIME]`
  * If betshop is CLOSED, clock label should present `Opens tomorrow at [START TIME]`
* Betshop detail data is presented in 3 rows:
  1. Name
  2. Address
  3. [City] - [County]
* Selected betshop has different asset (large green pin)
